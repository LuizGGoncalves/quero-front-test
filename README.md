# Quero-front-test
This project is a Vue.js application that has only one screen, where all user's favorite offers are listed in a card format. In addition, there is a modal on the page that allows users to filter offers by various types and add new offers to the favorites list. The modal displays an array of offers that the user can select and add to their list. With this project, users can easily manage and access their favorite offers on a single, intuitive page.
